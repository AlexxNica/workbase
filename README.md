## Grakn Workbase

![Grakn Workbase 1.0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/567679/45933937-7987bc00-bf8e-11e8-8b26-8fb020c77310.png)

Grakn Workbase is Grakn's Integrated Development Environment to perform knowledge engineering. At the moment, Workbase provides to main functionalities: visualisation of the knowledge graph, and modelling of the knowledge schema. 

You can also see Workbase as another interface for a user to interact with their Grakn database, as an alternative to the [Grakn Console](http://dev.grakn.ai/docs/running-grakn/console) and [Grkan Client API/Drivers](http://dev.grakn.ai/docs/client-api/overview).

Workbase allows us to execute Graql [`get`](/docs/query/get-query) and [`compute path`](/docs/query/compute-query#compute-the-shortest-path) queries, and visualise and investigate their results.
Whether you need a tool to test and experiment with your newly created Grakn knowledge graph, or that you prefer a graphical interface for reading data from Grakn, you will find Workbase extremely useful.
