## Grakn Workbase
The Grakn Workbase, along with the [Graql Console](http://dev.grakn.ai/docs/running-grakn/console) and the [Grakn Clients](http://dev.grakn.ai/docs/client-api/overview), is an interface through which we can read from a Grakn knowledge graph.
Workbase allows us to execute Graql [`get`](/docs/query/get-query) and [`compute path`](/docs/query/compute-query#compute-the-shortest-path) queries, and visualise and investigate their results.
Whether you need a tool to test and experiment with your newly created Grakn knowledge graph, or that you prefer a graphical interface for reading data from Grakn, you will find Workbase extremely useful.
